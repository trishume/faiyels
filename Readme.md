# faiyels

Faiyels is a source code visualizer that shows the code in all the files of your program in a massive overview kind of like
Sublime Text's minimap so you can see the size and texture of all the files.
It is written in Rust using Gfx and Conrod. It is also currently a barely implemented work in progress.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Draw lots of rectangles
- [ ] Draw lots of rectangles in the same places as a piece of text
- [ ] Draw lots of rectangles in the same places as the text in a file
- [ ] Add controls to navigate and zoom around
- [ ] Draw many files at once in a useful arrangement
- [ ] Colour the rectangles according to syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add fancy animated transitions to different arrangements of rectangles
- [ ] Show actual letters when you zoom in enough
