# faiyels

Faiyels is a source code visualizer that shows the lines of code of your program in a cool disk tree diagram.
It is written in Rust using Conrod. It is also currently a barely implemented work in progress.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Draw cool recursive pie chart graph
- [ ] Show data of a folder's files on the graph
- [ ] Integrate line counting code from tokei to count lines
- [ ] Drill down into subfolders of chart
- [ ] Other metrics like kb, kb gzipped
- [ ] Parallelize
